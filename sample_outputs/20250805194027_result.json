        "Given the patient's broken English, consider using simpler language and speaking slowly and clearly. Visual aids or translation services might be beneficial if available.",
        "Begin with open-ended questions to encourage the patient to share their concerns in their own words. For instance, 'What brings you in to see me today?'",
        "Gathering basic information should include more than just the reason for the visit. We need to ascertain things like allergies, current medications, past medical history, and relevant social history. While this would not all happen at once, it needs to be addressed."
